## The Expool (Explosion-School) Game

We've create the most basic game I ever seen.

### How to play

1. Check in the release section for the latest version of the game in .JAR. Then download it.

2. You'll need the Java VM (Version 17 or higher). I recommend you to use [JRE](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?package=jre).

3. Finally, double-click on the jar. Enjoy !
